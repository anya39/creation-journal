        <p>
            During this winter break, I've set a goal for myself: to spend more time creating.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lately, I've found myself so caught up in school and everything around it that I haven't taken the time to just make things. I often get stuck in the idea that if something isn't perfect — or at least “good enough” — then it isn't worth my time.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to move away from that mindset. I want to let myself be a beginner at different things and create simply for the love of the process, the way I did when I was younger.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the rest of winter break (and hopefully, once the new year starts too), I'll be creating something every day and documenting it here. This website is also something I'm learning to build for the first time, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even when what I make is messy or not very presentable, I'll still share it here, both to hold myself accountable and to remind myself that creating is a process.
